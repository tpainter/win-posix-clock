    POSIX clock functions for Windows
    https://github.com/tpainter/win-posix-clock

== Goals
The goal of this project is to provide the posix clock functions listed below:
  nanosleep
  clock_getres
  clock_gettime
  clock_settime
  clock_nanosleep

These functions compliment the typical pthreads-win32 library found here:
https://www.sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/



== Original Source forked from:
  * Web View: http://github.com/songdongsheng/libpthread
  * git clone git://github.com/songdongsheng/libpthread.git

The original libpthread appears to be an incomplete pthreads implimentation, but it does
include the clock functions missing in the pthreads-win32 library.
